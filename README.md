## END OF DEVELOPMENT NOTICE

#Â This package has been discontinued.

A tiny application and HTTP API framework for Express.js.

https://sw.cowtech.it/apes.js

## Supported implementations.

apes.js is written using async/await, which is available from Node 7.0.0 using `--harmony_async-await` flag.

## Usage

### Standalone application

To create a Node.js application which already takes care of logging, call the `Application.execute` and provide a main function.

The function will be called with a `application` object, which has a `logger` setup.

```javascript
const apes = require("apes")

apes.Application.execute("confRoot", application => {
  // Do something here
})
```

### HTTP Server

To create a fully working light-weight HTTP server, call `HTTPServer.execute` providing a root key in the `package.json` and a main function.

The function will be called with a `server` object, which has a `express` property to define routes.

```javascript
const apes = require("apes")

apes.HTTPServer.execute("confRoot.http", server => {
  // Do something here - Core logic goes here, by adding routes to server.express
})
```
